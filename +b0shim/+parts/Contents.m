% b0shim.parts â€” Shim system components
% 
% Classes in `+b0shim/+parts` define parameter templates for specific shim
% system components. Practically, the classes define properties of the general
% system configuration template `b0shim.Specs`. The classes consist only of
% properties and their constructors likely won't need to be called outside of
% `b0shim.Specs`.
